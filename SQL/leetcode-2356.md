## Solution

Create table If Not Exists Teacher (teacher_id int, subject_id int, dept_id int);
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '2', '3');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '2', '4');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '3', '3');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '1',leetcode '1');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '2', '1');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '3', '1');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '4', '1');

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select teacher_id, count(distinct subject_id) as cnt from Teacher
group by teacher_id;
