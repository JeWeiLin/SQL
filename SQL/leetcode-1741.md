## 1741. Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee
```
Table: Employees

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| emp_id      | int  |
| event_day   | date |
| in_time     | int  |
| out_time    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.
in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.
```

```
Input: 
Employees table:
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
Output: 
+------------+--------+------------+
| day        | emp_id | total_time |
+------------+--------+------------+
| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |
| 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |
| 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |
| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |
+------------+--------+------------+
Explanation: 
Employee 1 has three events: two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (32 - 4) + (200 - 55) = 173, and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total of (42 - 1) = 41.
Employee 2 has two events: one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (33 - 3) = 30, and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.
```


## Solution 
```
Create table If Not Exists Employees(emp_id int, event_day date, in_time int, out_time int);
insert into Employees (emp_id, event_day, in_time, out_time) values ('1', '2020-11-28', '4', '32');
insert into Employees (emp_id, event_day, in_time, out_time) values ('1', '2020-11-28', '55', '200');
insert into Employees (emp_id, event_day, in_time, out_time) values ('1', '2020-12-3', '1', '42');
insert into Employees (emp_id, event_day, in_time, out_time) values ('2', '2020-11-28', '3', '33');
insert into Employees (emp_id, event_day, in_time, out_time) values ('2', '2020-12-9', '47', '74');

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT event_day as day, emp_id, sum(out_time-in_time) AS total_time FROM Employees
group by emp_id, event_day;
```
