## Problem 1757
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

## Solution 

Create table If Not Exists Products (product_id int, low_fats ENUM('Y', 'N'), recyclable ENUM('Y','N'));
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('0', 'Y', 'N');
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('1', 'Y', 'Y');
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('2', 'N', 'Y');
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('3', 'Y', 'Y');
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('4', 'N', 'N');

select product_id from Products
where low_fats='Y' and recyclable='Y';

| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |
+-------------+------+
(subject_id, dept_id) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.

Example 1:

Input: 
Teacher table:
+------------+------------+---------+
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |
+------------+------------+---------+
Output:  
+------------+-----+
| teacher_id | cnt |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |
+------------+-----+
Explanation: 
Teacher 1:
  - They teach subject 2 in departments 3 and 4.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 3.
Teacher 2:
  - They teach subject 1 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 2 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 4 in department 1.

## Solution 
Create table If Not Exists Teacher (teacher_id int, subject_id int, dept_id int);
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '2', '3');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '2', '4');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('1', '3', '3');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '1',leetcode '1');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '2', '1');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '3', '1');
insert into Teacher (teacher_id, subject_id, dept_id) values ('2', '4', '1');

select teacher_id, count(distinct subject_id) as cnt from Teacher
group by teacher_id;
